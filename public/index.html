<!--we wrap our HTTP server in Socket.IO and it intercepts requests for "/socket.io/socket.io.js" and sends
<!--the appropriate response automatically. This way we load the library available from the server when we -->
<!--initiate the socket.io and it's the needed path for socket.io to work -->
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script>
    // io() is method available to us from the above library. When we call it, we initiate a request from the client
    // to the server to open up a web socket and keep that connection open. Socket variable is critical to
    // communicating between client and server. It's needed to listen for data from the server and to send data from
    // client to the server
    var socket = io();

    // the on event is the same as the on event on the server. In this case we don't have access to the
    // socket argument since we have it already above
    socket.on('connect', () => { // when there is a connection
        console.log('Connected to server');
    })

    socket.on('disconnect', () => { // when disconnected
        console.log('Disconnected from server');
    })
